# Key phrases I will use in my report:

The *Assymetry* part of the TAGAN is somewhat of a misnomer. The snapshots in the temporal propogation *do* represent assymetrical states, however, in order to properly integrate there states into a deeplearning tensor framework, we have to recontextualise the snapshots feature space into a consistant form. Notable derivations of such a method include masking *with regards to natural language processing and decoder algorithms*.  

several possible methodologies of assymetric consolidation were considered, such as PCA, procrustes analysis, however, considering the predictive intention of the framework, we will want to retain each nodes individual representations in the network at any time. This is to not only facilitate a more elegant memory banking but also serves to bolster the predictions of spefic nodes in subsequent snapshots. 

A user on a social media site like X.com (*formally twitter*) may entire the network at a specific snapshot. We want to identify the actions of this user.
